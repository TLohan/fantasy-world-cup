# Golazo
This is a website which displays a score board for a World Cup 2018 sweepstakes.

Each player is assigned one team from the four seeded pots. Points are awarded for goals scored as follows:

|Pot |Points|
|-----|---|
|  A | 1 | 
|  B | 2 |
|  C | 3 |
|  D | 4 |

The player with the most points at the end of the competition wins the prizemoney.

All goals that count towards the competition's golden boot are counted.

The data is collected from Fifa'a API.
